## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Prompts

### If AI Skips Steps:
```
STOP! You must follow the exact workflow for this MCP:

1. You MUST access file://example/processed_products.md FIRST
2. You MUST use parse_raw_text_to_json to generate JSON
3. You MUST use convert_json_to_html to create HTML

Please start over and follow each step in order. Do not skip any steps.
```

### If AI Doesn't Access Template:
```
Before processing any data, you MUST first access the template:
- Use: access_mcp_resource
- URI: file://example/processed_products.md

This is MANDATORY to understand the expected format. Please do this first, then proceed with parsing.
```
